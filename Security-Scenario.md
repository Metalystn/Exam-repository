# Security Quality Scenario: Course Validation

## Context
- **Stimulus**: Unauthorized user.
- **Behavior**: Attempts to bypass validation to create a course with invalid data.

## System Description
- **Artifact**: Course Validator.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Detects and rejects invalid input.
  - Logs failed validation attempts.
  - Notifies the system administrator of suspicious activities.

## Security Objective
- **Goal**: Prevent unauthorized users from compromising the integrity of the system by introducing invalid or malicious data.

## Key Features
1. **Input Validation**:
   - Strictly enforces data integrity rules.
   - Blocks any data that fails validation criteria.

2. **Audit Trail**:
   - Logs all failed validation attempts for monitoring and analysis.
   - Ensures accountability by capturing relevant details (e.g., timestamp, user ID, input data).

3. **Real-Time Alerts**:
   - Immediately notifies administrators about suspicious or repeated failed attempts.
   - Enables timely intervention to address potential security threats.

## Performance Goal
- **Key Metric**: Detection and rejection time.
  - **Target**: Less than 2 seconds to detect, reject, and log unauthorized input.

## Rationale
- **Why it matters**:
  - Ensures the artifact (Course Validator) remains resilient to attacks targeting input validation mechanisms.
  - Protects sensitive data and system functionality from unauthorized manipulation.
  - Enhances overall trust in the system by maintaining data accuracy and consistency.
