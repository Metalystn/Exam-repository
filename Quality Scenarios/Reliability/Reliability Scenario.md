### Quality Attribute: Reliability

- Stimulus: A database node experiences a sudden crash while processing enrollment request.
- Artifact: `enrollment history`, `enrollment repository` and `enroll databse`
- Environment: The system operates with active monitoring and failover capabilities.
- Response:
  - The system detects the database failure and automatically fails over to a replica node.
  - The order-processing service retries the enrollment request and completes it successfully without user intervention.
  - An alert is logged and sent to the operations team for further investigation.
- Response Measure:
  - The failover process completes within 3 seconds.
  - The transaction is processed successfully with no data loss.
  - 99.99% of user transactions are successfully completed during the outage period.

The architecture requires:
- High-Availability Database Cluster:
  - Use a clustered database setup with a primary node and multiple replicas (e.g., MySQL with replication).
- Data Integrity
  - Atomic Transactions: Ensure all database operations are part of atomic transactions to maintain consistency.
- Monitoring and Alerting
  - Health Monitoring: MOnitor the status of the database nodes.

The architecture requirements does not constitude a change in the diagrams as it is a requirement of the external database system.
