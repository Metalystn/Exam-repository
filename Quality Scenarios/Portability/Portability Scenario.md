### Portability Scenario

- Source: The system owner.
- Stimulus: A requirement emerges to extend the current web-based enrollment system to operate as a desktop application.
- Artifact: The enrollment system, including the front-end user interface and back-end APIs.
- Environment: The web application currently runs on a browser, while the desktop application must run on Windows.
- Response:
  - The systemâ€™s core functionality is successfully adapted to a desktop application.
  - The back-end APIs remains unchanged and are reused without modification.
  - The desktop application integrates seamlessly with the existing back-end, providing consistent functionality and user experience.
- Response Measure:
  - The desktop application is deployed and tested on Windows.
  - All web features are functional without additional back-end changes.

### Architectural Requirements for Portability

- Consistent Data Handling:
  - Ensure data models are consistent across web and desktop applications.

- Separation of Concerns:
  - Ensure a clear separation between the front-end and back-end.

- Reusable Components:
  - Use shared components or libraries for common UI elements and logic to minimize redevelopment effort.
