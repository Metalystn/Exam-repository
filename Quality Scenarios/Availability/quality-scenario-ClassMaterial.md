### Quality Scenario: Availability

- **Stimulus**: A ClassMaterial Database failure happens during peak usage (while students are submitting homework).
- **Source of Stimulus**: Infrastructure issue or database failure.
- **Environment**: During a peak homework upload.
- **Artifact**: 
  - `Class Material Database Communicator`
  - `Homework Controller`
- **Response**:
  1. The system detects the database failure.
  2. Homework submissions are temporarily stored in an in-memory storage within the `Homework Controller`.
  3. Submissions are queued, and uploaded to database once it is back online.
  4. Users are notified of the successful submission despite the database issue.
- **Response Measure**:
  - Homework submissions are not lost during the failure.
  - The system synchronizes queued data with the `ClassMaterial Database` within 1 hour after the database is restored.

The architecture requires:
1. **Caching Mechanism**: An in-memory storage module to the `Homework Controller` to temporarily store submissions.
2. **Synchronization Service**: Service or process that brings back the cached data with the `ClassMaterial Database` once it is up.
3. **Failure Detection**: Enhance the `Class Material Database Communicator` to detect failures.
