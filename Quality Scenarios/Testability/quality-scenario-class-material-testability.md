# Testability Quality Scenario

## Stimulus
A tester prepares and executes a set of tests to validate the **Homework Controller** and its associated components (e.g., **Homework Verifier**) under controlled conditions.

---

## Source of Stimulus
The **tester** (a user or an automated testing framework) initiates the tests by submitting file upload scenarios.

---

## Artifact
The **Homework Controller** and **Homework Verifier**.

---

## Environment
The tests are performed in a **dedicated testing environment**, where:
- Mock data simulates real-world scenarios (e.g., valid and invalid file uploads).
- Testing tools interact with the system using specialized APIs designed for controllability.

---

## Response
- The **Homework Controller** processes the test inputs, delegating validation to the **Homework Verifier**.
- The system generates clear, observable outputs for each test case:
  - Valid files are accepted and processed.
  - Invalid files are rejected with detailed error messages.
- Logs are generated for every decision, capturing input data and outcomes.

---

## Response Measure
- **Fault Detection**: The system quickly identifies and handles invalid files.
- **Coverage**: All defined validation rules (e.g., file size, format) are tested.
- **Observability**: Detailed logs capture every decision, ensuring faults are traceable.

## Testability Tactic: **Controllability**

### Description
Focus on adding **specialized interfaces** (APIs) to control and simulate system inputs during tests. This allows testers to:
- Inject controlled inputs (e.g., mock file uploads) into the **Homework Controller**.
- Monitor the system's response to these inputs in real-time.

### Implementation in the System
1. **Specialized Testing API**:
   - Exposes endpoints in the **Homework Controller** for injecting test scenarios and retrieving outcomes.
   - Supports automated frameworks to streamline repetitive testing tasks.
2. **Input Simulation**:
   - Mock data (valid and invalid files) is injected into the system via the Testing API.
3. **Immediate Feedback**:
   - The system provides detailed responses for every test case, allowing testers to observe and validate outcomes.
