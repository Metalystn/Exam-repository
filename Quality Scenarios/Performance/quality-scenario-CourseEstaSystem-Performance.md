### Run-time Dimension

#### Quality Scenario: Performance

- **Stimulus:** The system receives a large number of concurrent requests for processing.
 
- **Source of Stimulus:** A peak period with multiple users submitting course data simultaneously.

- **Environment:** Production environment with high concurrency.

- **Artifact:**
  - `CourseValidator`
  - `Course database communicator`

- **Response:**
  - Requests are queued using a task queue.
  - The system processes the requests in parallel using a pool of worker threads.
  - Users are notified of their request status (e.g., queued or processed).

- **Response Measure:**
  - Throughput is maintained at a consistent rate (e.g., 100 requests per second).
  - All requests are processed within a specified timeframe (e.g., 60 seconds).

##### The architecture requires:

- **Task Queue:** A distributed queue to handle incoming validation requests.
- **Worker Threads:** A thread pool to process requests concurrently.
- **Load Balancing:** Distribute validation tasks across available system resources.
