# Testability Quality Scenario

## Stimulus
A tester wants to verify that the **Homework Controller** properly validates uploaded homework files for compliance with file extension and size constraints.

---

## Source of Stimulus
The system tester executes a predefined set of tests using simulated file uploads (e.g., valid and invalid files).

---

## Artifact
The **Homework Controller** and its subcomponent, the **Homework Verifier**.

---

## Environment
The system is in a **testing environment** where mock data simulates real scenarios:
- Test files of various sizes and formats are submitted.
- The system is running in a controlled state with logging enabled.

---

## Response
- The **Homework Controller** processes the requests and delegates file validation to the **Homework Verifier**.
- The **Homework Verifier**:
  - Rejects files exceeding the maximum size.
  - Rejects files with unsupported extensions.
  - Accepts and processes valid files.
- The system logs the results for each test case, including:
  - The reason for rejecting invalid files.
  - Confirmation of accepted files.

---

## Response Measure
- **Detection**: Faulty inputs (e.g., oversized files, unsupported formats) are identified and rejected 100% of the time.
- **Coverage**: All validation rules (size, extension) are tested and logged.
- **Efficiency**: Each test case completes within 2 seconds.
- **Observability**: Test logs provide sufficient detail for debugging and troubleshooting.

## Modifications to the C4 Diagram

### Changes Required
To ensure the system supports **testability**, the following modifications should be made to the C4 diagram:

1. **Add a Testing Framework Component**:
   - Introduce a component in the **Business Layer** to simulate test cases and validate responses.
   - Label it as **Testing Framework** or **Testing Interface**.

2. **Enhance Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Add a **Logging and Monitoring** component in the **Persistence Layer** to record validation results, reasons for failure, and system states.
   - Connect components like **Homework Verifier** and **Class Material Authenticator** to this logging system.

3. **Illustrate Specialized Testing Interfaces**:
   - Add connections between the **Testing Framework** and components such as the **Homework Controller** and **Lecture Material Controller**, showing specialized APIs for testing.

4. **Include a Test Data Repository**:
   - Introduce a **Test Data Repository** in the **Persistence Layer** to store mock data and reusable test cases.


---

### Justification for Modifications
- **Testing Framework**: Centralizes and streamlines test execution and validation.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Increases observability, making debugging and validation easier.
- **Test Data Repository**: Provides reusable and consistent test data for various scenarios.
- **Testing Environment**: Prevents interference with production workflows, ensuring a safe testing process.
